# 1997-webpage
A warcraft 2 webpage I did with my brother in 1997 (at the age of 11)! Now part of the National Library of Sweden's exhibition 'Virtual 90's webpages' (https://www.kb.se/om-oss/nyheter/nyhetsarkiv/2018-06-27-virtu-el-la-90-talshem-blir-histo-ria-pa-kb.html). Also hosted at www.ljugare.com.
